JetTrivia

JetTrivia is a simple yet dynamic Quiz Application built using modern Android development practices. The app fetches quiz questions from a JSON payload via Retrofit, manages dependency injection with Hilt Dagger, and stores user-selected answers locally using Room Database. The project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern for clean and maintainable code.

Key Features:

1. Fetches quiz questions from remote JSON API

2. Stores user responses locally with Room

3. Dependency injection setup with Hilt

4. Clean architecture using MVVM

5. Modern Android tools and libraries
